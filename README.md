# PUBG Game Prediction Model

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting player performance in PUBG (PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds) using machine learning models. By analyzing player statistics and gameplay metrics, the model provides insights into performance factors, helping players understand how to improve their rankings and enabling game developers to balance gameplay dynamics.

## Motivation
PUBG is one of the most popular battle royale games, with millions of active players worldwide. The competitive nature of the game makes performance prediction an exciting challenge. This project aims to:
- Provide actionable insights into player performance.
- Analyze gameplay metrics and identify key performance drivers.
- Build a scalable, accurate model for predicting outcomes based on game data.

## Dataset
The dataset includes detailed player statistics, such as:
- **Damage Dealt**: Total damage inflicted on opponents.
- **Kill Count**: Number of players eliminated.
- **Walk Distance**: Total distance traveled on foot.
- **Boosts and Heals**: Number of healing items used.
- **Team Size**: Number of teammates in the game.
- **Match Type**: Game mode (solo, duo, squad).

The dataset is sourced from Kaggle and includes thousands of matches, offering diverse gameplay scenarios for analysis.

## Key Features

### Data Preprocessing
- Handled missing values and duplicates.
- Normalized data for uniform scaling.
- Engineered features such as kill-to-death ratio, total distance traveled, and headshot percentage.
- Analyzed data distributions and identified outliers.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyzed player trends, such as the correlation between kills and match ranking.
- Visualized data using histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps.
- Investigated the impact of factors like team size and match type on performance.

### Model Development
- Experimented with multiple machine learning algorithms, including:
  - Random Forest
  - Gradient Boosting Machines
  - XGBoost
- Split data into training and testing sets for robust evaluation.
- Fine-tuned hyperparameters using grid search.

### Evaluation Metrics
- Used metrics like Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and R-squared to assess model accuracy.
- Visualized prediction errors to identify areas of improvement.

## Results
The model achieved:
- High predictive accuracy with minimal overfitting.
- Significant insights into the most important features influencing player rankings.
- Intuitive visualizations that help players and developers understand performance drivers.

## Challenges
- Handling large-scale datasets with varied gameplay scenarios.
- Managing highly skewed distributions in features like kill count.
- Balancing model complexity to avoid overfitting while maintaining interpretability.

## Why This Project Stands Out
1. **Real-World Relevance**: Addresses real-world gaming scenarios with actionable insights.
2. **Scalability**: The methodology can be extended to other games or datasets.
3. **Practical Impact**: Helps players strategize and improve their performance while aiding developers in optimizing gameplay design.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pubg-game-prediction.git
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook for data preprocessing, EDA, and model training:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook PUBG_Game_Prediction.ipynb
   ```
4. Explore the visualizations and insights generated by the model.

## Future Work
- Integrate deep learning models like Neural Networks to improve accuracy.
- Include real-time data streaming for live predictions during matches.
- Expand analysis to cover additional game metrics, such as weapon usage and vehicle data.

## Conclusion
The PUBG Game Prediction Model is a comprehensive tool for analyzing player performance. By leveraging machine learning, this project bridges the gap between raw gameplay data and actionable insights, making it a valuable resource for players and game developers alike.
